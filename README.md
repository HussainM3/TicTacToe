# TicTacToe
This is a TicTacToe game that I have programmed in java through concepts taught in my computer science classes.
- Begin by running the TicTacToeMenu java file. This file calls the other java files within it.
- Ensure that the images folder with the required images is attached
TODO:
- Make single player mode
